    In the year 1998 the queen was born, her great family named her Aisha Fadalla(Kaka).She grew
    up in a family of seven children and she is the first born in the family.
    Being the first born she never enjoyed her childhood because her parents were busy all the time
     and she had to take all the responsibilities of the house work as well as taking care of young ones.<br>
    
    She is from Sudan, in a region called Nuba Mountain.Though its not a developed place completely,
    she still loves it the way it is because that’s where she came from and  people
     living there have respect, care and love each other. They also live in unity.
    Due to the certain cultures still being practiced by the community she decided not to get married
    but go and further her education in another country (Kenya). She hopes to be a great role model to
    many young women in her community.<br>
    
    She stands for freedom, accountability and she believes that nothing is impossible  yet still nothing
    great comes on a silver platter. </p>
